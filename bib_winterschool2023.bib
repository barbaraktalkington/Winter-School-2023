	abstract = {"In an age of big data, data journalism and with a wealth of quantitative information around us, it is not enough for students to be taught only 100 year old statistical methods using ′out of the box′ software. They need to have 21st- century analytical skills too.This is an excellent and student-friendly text from two of the world leaders in the teaching and development of spatial analysis.It shows clearly why the open source software R is not just an alternative to commercial {GIS}, it may actually be the better choice for mapping, analysis and for replicable research.Providing practical tips as well as fully working code, this is a practical ′how to′ guide ideal for undergraduates as well as those using R for the first time.It will be required reading on my own courses."  -Richard Harris, Professor of Quantitative Social Science, University of Brist\#strong/strong\#  R is a powerful open source computing tool that supports geographical analysis and mapping for the many geography and ‘non-geography’ students and researchers interested in spatial analysis and mapping.   This book provides an introduction to the use of R for spatial statistical analysis, geocomputation and the analysis of geographical information for researchers collecting and using data with location attached, largely through increased {GPS} functionality.   Brunsdon and Comber take readers from ‘zero to hero’ in spatial analysis and mapping through functions they have developed and compiled into R packages. This enables practical R applications in {GIS}, spatial analyses, spatial statistics, mapping, and web-scraping. Each chapter includes:Example data and commands for exploring {itScripts} and coding to exemplify specific {functionalityAdvice} for developing greater understanding - through functions such as locator(), View(), and alternative coding to achieve the same {endsSelf}-contained exercises for students to work {throughEmbedded} code within the descriptive text. This is a definitive ′how to′ that takes students - of any discipline - from coding to actual applications and uses of R.},

	doi = {10.1017/S0003055404001194},
	abstract = {We develop a Bayesian procedure for estimation and inference for spatial models of roll call voting. This approach is extremely flexible, applicable to any legislative setting, irrespective of size, the extremism of the legislators' voting histories, or the number of roll calls available for analysis. The model is easily extended to let other sources of information inform the analysis of roll call data, such as the number and nature of the underlying dimensions, the presence of party whipping, the determinants of legislator preferences, and the evolution of the legislative agenda; this is especially helpful since generally it is inappropriate to use estimates of extant methods (usually generated under assumptions of sincere voting) to test models embodying alternate assumptions (e.g., log-rolling, party discipline). A Bayesian approach also provides a coherent framework for estimation and inference with roll call data that eludes extant methods; moreover, via Bayesian simulation methods, it is straightforward to generate uncertainty assessments or hypothesis tests concerning any auxiliary quantity of interest or to formally compare models. In a series of examples we show how our method is easily extended to accommodate theoretically interesting models of legislative behavior. Our goal is to provide a statistical framework for combining the measurement of legislative preferences with tests of models of legislative behavior.},
